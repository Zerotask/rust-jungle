# Rust Jungle

Rust Jungle is a learning platform to learn the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
It is based on the awesome [Tour of Rust](https://github.com/richardanaya/tour_of_rust)
and is built with the high-performance JS framework [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit).

Rust has a steep learning curve and for some people this might be the reason to look for an alternative.
In my experience, once you've learned Rust, you will love it. Others share my experience, otherwise
it wouldn't be the [most loved language for four years in a row](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/).

The goal of Rust Jungle is to give you an easy start with the Rust programming language with
short but useful lessons, separated into stages.

And you are not alone! [Ferris the crab](https://www.rustacean.net/) will be with you!

## Still in development

This project is still in development and there can be fundamental changes. After the english section is done, we will start adding new languages.
