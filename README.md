# Rust Jungle

WARNING: STILL IN DEVELOPMENT! NOT COMPLETE!

Rust Jungle is based on the awesome [Tour of Rust](https://github.com/richardanaya/tour_of_rust)
and is built with the high-performance JS framework [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit).

Rust has a steep learning curve and for some people this might be the reason to look for an alternative.
In my experience, once you've learned Rust, you will love it. Others share my experience, otherwise
it wouldn't be the [most loved language for four years in a row](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/).

Therefore Rust Jungle will try help you navigating to all the major topics of the Rust programming language.

And you are not alone! [Ferris the crab](https://www.rustacean.net/) will be with you!

Big thanks to [opeNode.io](https://www.openode.io/) where this bot is hosted for free!
