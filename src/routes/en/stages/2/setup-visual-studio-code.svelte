		> for developing Rust programs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Visual Studio Code is a modular editor which can be extended with with useful tools (called <i
			>extensions</i
		>) to improve your developing experience for Rust programming.
	</p>

	<p>
		Besides <a

			target="_blank">the official Rust extension</a
		>
		there are also <i>extension packs</i> which offers some additional tools often needed for Rust programming,
		e. g. an extension for TOML files.
