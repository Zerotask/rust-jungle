		Nice job so far! The basics of Rust aren't so bad, right? We're getting a peek into how the Rust
		compiler thinks. As a system programming language it cares a lot about the size of values in
		memory, whether things can be modified or not, and making sure your math is what you want it to
		be.

	<p>
		In the next stage we will learn how to install Rust locally and how to develop and test a very
		simple program.
