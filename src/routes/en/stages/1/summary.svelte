		Nice job so far! The basics of Rust aren't so bad, right? We're getting a peek into how the Rust
		compiler thinks. As a system programming language it cares a lot about the size of values in
		memory, whether things can be modified or not, and making sure your math is what you want it to
		be. Next up we'll be looking at some old friends: <code>if</code> tests and <code>for</code> loops.
