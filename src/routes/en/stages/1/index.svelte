<Lesson title="Stage 1.1: Introduction" next="1/the-rust-playground">
	<p>
		In the first stage we're going to be exploring the very basics with functions, variables, and
		the most primitive types. Glad to have you on board!
	</p>

	<p>
		Also! In case you are wondering who this adorable crab who is speaking to you is, I am Ferris,
		the unofficial mascot for the Rust programming language. Nice to meet you.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once you get familiar with Rust, you can call yourself a Rustacean. That's how people who use,
		contribute or are interested in Rust call themself.
