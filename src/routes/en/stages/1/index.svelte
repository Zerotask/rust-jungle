		In this first chapter we're going to be exploring the very basics with functions, variables, and
		the most primitive types. Glad to have you on board!

		Also! In case you are wondering who this adorable crab who is speaking to you is, I am Ferris,
		the unofficial mascot for the Rust programming language. Nice to meet you.

		Once you get familiar with Rust, you can call yourself a Rustacean. That's how people who use,
		contribute or are interested in Rust call themself.
