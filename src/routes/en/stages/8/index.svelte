	<p>
		Expressing ideas with functions is a proven way of representing behavior and data (C has been
		doing it for decades!). Historically, computer science has found other useful expressive
		aggregations and abstractions for data. You may be familiar with object oriented programming
		(OOP) as one such way. In this chapter we'll explore the Rust programming language beyond
		functions.
