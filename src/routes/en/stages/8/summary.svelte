	<p>
		We now have more language features at hand to represent our ideas clearly! Rust abstractions
		might be simple but they are powerful enough to make working with code a joy. In this chapter,
		we caught a glimpse of smart pointers with <code>Box</code>. In the next chapter we'll learn
		about how smart pointers can help us with other specialized memory situations.
