	<p>
		Object oriented programming roughly refers to programming languages that have a number of iconic
		features:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>Encapsulation</i> - Associating data and functions into the conceptual unit of a single type
			called an object.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Abstraction</i> - Hiding data and function members to obfuscate implementation details of an
			object.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Polymorphism</i> - The ability to interact with objects of different types through one interface.
		</li>
		<li><i>Inheritance</i> - The ability to inherit data and behavior from other objects.</li>
	</ul>
